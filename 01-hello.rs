// Double slashes denote comments

// Rust is a general-purpose programming language
// with a focus on performance while ensuring
// memory safety without using a garbage collector at runtime,
// which is a form of automatic memory management

// The following examples focus more on the interesting features
// of rust to hopefully help you decide whether you'd like to consider
// learning more about rust

// Rust has a C-like syntax with curly braces and semicolons
// Functions are defined with the `fn` keyword
// All rust programs start with a `main` function
fn main() {
    // Use `println` to print to the standard output
    // `println` is a macro, NOT a function, so it requires a `!`
    // Macros are an advanced topic that can be treated as "magic" for now
    // Most statements must end with a `;`.
    println!("Hello, world!");
