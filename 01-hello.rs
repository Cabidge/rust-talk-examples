// Double slashes denote comments

// Rust is a general-purpose programming language
// with a focus on high performance without
// sacrificing memory safety

// Rust has a C-like syntax with curly braces and semicolons
// Functions are defined with the `fn` keyword
// All rust programs start with a `main` function
fn main() {
    // The println macro can be used to print to stdout
    // Most statements must end with a `;`.
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
