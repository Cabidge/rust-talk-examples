// Double slashes denote comments

// Rust is a general-purpose programming language
// with performance comparable to low level languages like C++
// while ensuring memory safety without a garbage collector

// Rust is meant to be an alternative to languages like C and C++
// while still feeling like a high level programming language

// The following examples are meant to give a high-level overview
// of the more interesting features of rust to help you decide
// whether you'd like to choose rust as your next language to learn

// Rust has a C-like syntax with curly braces and semicolons
// Functions are defined with the `fn` keyword
// All rust programs start with a `main` function
fn main() {
    // Use `println` to print to the standard output
    // `println` is a macro, NOT a function, so it requires a `!`
    // Macros are an advanced topic that can be treated as "magic" for now
    // Most statements must end with a `;`.
    println!("Hello, world!");
